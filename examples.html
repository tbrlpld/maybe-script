            <h2 class="span-2">Superseded HTML controls</h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    When we enhance some existing HTML functionality with dynamic behavior, some of the HTML elements are not needed anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider a filter or search form.
                    For the HTML implementation, you want there to be a "submit" button so that the form can be sent to the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, when the form is enhanced with functionality that automatically submits the form and updates the results list, the "submit" button is now superfluous.
                    Even worse, it may even confuse users.
                    The existence of the button might distract them from the fact that the results have already been updated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can remove the button with the script.
                    However, when JS is slow to load and execute, we get a layout shift from the disappearing button.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    We want to avoid the layout shift caused by the disappearing button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We only want the button to be available when the script did not enhance the form to submit automatically.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-display">
                <form action="" method="get">
                    <input type="search" name="q" data-submit-on-blur>
                    <button type="submit">Search</button>
                </form>
            </div>
            <div class="example-display">
                <form action="" method="get">
                    <input type="search" name="q" data-submit-on-blur>
                    <maybe-script src="main.js">
                        <button type="submit">Search</button>
                    </maybe-script>
                </form>
            </div>

            <h2 class="span-2">Controls that require scripting</h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    When you add dynamic behavior the a page with scripting, you likely add new elements for the user to trigger the new behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pretty much any <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> falls into this category.
                    Unless it is a "sumbit" button in a form, it dosen't do anything with out the required script having loaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid showing these elements when they are not functional (i.e. when the script fails to load) you can hide them via styling of the `hidden` attribute.
                    When the script loads, it removes the respective class or `hidden` attribute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "showing" of the button leads to a layout shift.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    We want to avoid that layout shift from showing the button in the success case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To cover the "no JS" case, we also want to hide the button in the beginning.
                    But, if JS is available we want to show the button before the first paint.
                    Then, we only remove the button again when the script fails.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-display">
                <button data-disclosure data-disclosure-toggles="example-1" hidden>Toggle content below</button>
            </div>
            <div class="example-display">
                <maybe-script src="main.js">
                    <button data-disclosure data-disclosure-toggles="example-2">Toggle content below</button>
                </maybe-script>
            </div>

            <h2 class="span-2">Disclosure content</h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The content is rendered normally into the page.
                    When JS is loaded and run successfully then it hides the content.
                    When JS is slow, you first see the content and then it disappears.
                    You can show the content again by using the toggle button of the disclosure element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having the content visible in the content means is can be viewd even when JS fails.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    We want to avoid the layout shift caused by initial display of the content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wrap the content with <code>&lt;maybe-script&gt;</code> to hide it.
                    But, we need the content to be "shown" once JS is successfully loaded and run (so after the "load" event).
                    "Shown" in this case means that the <code>&lt;maybe-script&gt;</code> is shown.
                    The content itself is now hidden by the JS behaviour.
                    The toggle can be used to actually show the content.
                    If we didn't show the <code>&lt;maybe-script&gt;</code> then we could never show the inner content again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When JS fails to load, we also want to show the content so that it is accessible without any JS.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-display">
                <p class="important-banner" data-disclosure-content="example-1">
                    This is some content.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="example-display">
                <!-- Since we hide and show this one with JS, we only need the delay for the content. -->
                <maybe-script src="main.js">
                    <p class="important-banner" data-disclosure-content="example-2">
                        This is some conent.
                    </p>
                </maybe-script>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
