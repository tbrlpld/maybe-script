                <td>
                    <p>
                        The content is rendered normally into the page.
                        When JS is loaded and run successfully then it hides the content.
                        When JS is slow, you first see the content and then it disappears.
                        You can show the content again by using the toggle button of the disclosure element.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having the content visible in the content means is can be viewd even when JS fails.
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        We want to avoid the layout shift caused by  initial display of the content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We wrap the content with <code>&lt;maybe-script&gt;</code> to hide it.
                        But, we need the content to be "shown" once JS is successfully loaded and run (so after the "load" event).
                        "Shown" in this case means that the <code>&lt;maybe-script&gt;</code> is shown.
                        The content itself is now hidden by the JS behaviour.
                        The toggle can be used to actually show the content.
                        If we didn't show the <code>&lt;maybe-script&gt;</code> then we could never show the inner content again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When JS fails to load, we also want to show the content so that it is accessible without any JS.
